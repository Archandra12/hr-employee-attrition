Detail of project,

This project was developed as part of INSAID capstone project to help INSAID HR to identify employees who may quit in near future. The data was sourced from HRMS where data of all past and current employees was recorded for last 15 years.

In this project the outcome is a classification where we judge if the employee is likely to quit or not.
